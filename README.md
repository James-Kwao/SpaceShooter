## Introduction
Welcome to **Space Shooter**, an exciting word-based typing game set in space! The objective of the game is to type the words that appear on the screen before they reach your spaceship. Each word represents an enemy, and by typing the word correctly, you shoot and destroy the enemy. Sharpen your typing skills while you defend your spaceship from incoming threats!

---

## Game Overview
In **Space Shooter**, you are the commander of a spaceship, tasked with surviving an onslaught of enemy ships. But instead of traditional weaponry, your most powerful tool is your keyboard! As words appear on the screen, you must type them accurately and quickly to destroy the enemies before they reach your ship. The game gets progressively harder as words become more complex and enemies increase in speed.

### Objectives:
- Type words as fast and accurately as possible.
- Prevent enemy ships (words) from reaching your spaceship.
- Survive as long as you can and achieve high scores!

## Features
- **Fun and Engaging Gameplay**: Practice your typing skills while playing an exciting game.
- **Progressive Difficulty**: As the game advances, enemies become faster, and words become harder to type.

## How to Play
1. Words will appear on the screen, representing incoming enemy ships.
2. For every word typed correctly, your score increases.

4. The game ends if too many enemies collide with your ship.
